    "title": "What is Capoeira?",
    "description": "Capoeira (pronounced ka-poo-ay-da) is a martial art developed in Brazil by enslaved Africans. It is a communal game in which two opponents play each other inside a circle, formed by the other players who create rhythm for the game by clapping, singing and playing traditional instruments.",
    "extendedDescription": "The two \"capoeiristas\" play a game together using capoeira movements, camouflaging self-defense kicks with playful acrobatics and dance-like moves, spontaneously creating a strategy to fool the other player and perhaps catch them off guard. At the same time, the two players work together to build a beautiful, harmonic and naturally-flowing game.",
